## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

What I learned is how important it is to structure your html semantics properly as a good structuring makes your work easier when it is time to style. I raan into a lot of problems because of this and almost had to resart the whole project. I also learnt of the proper way to space and manipulate elements so as to maintain responsiveness. I also learnt about the dynamics using the "absolute" property can have on an element. 

### Continued development

Going forward, I will like to focus on my media queries as I have not fully mastered how to achieve exact replica of figma designs. Also I will like to explore the use of other measuring units other than px


### Useful resources

-(https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) - Amazing website which helped a lot in my onboarding and introduction to web development. All concepts are explaind as simply as possible with exercises at the end to help get practical experience
- Gemini AI - It was very impactful in explaing concepts and highlighting my mistakes helping me realise I did not understand as much as I thought I did. It was very helpful in particular in teaching me how to debug using the browser's inspect. The guidiance helped in making me not get overwhelmed.
